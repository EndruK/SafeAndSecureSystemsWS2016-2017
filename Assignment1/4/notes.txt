a)
- 1st loop will print the numbers from 1 to 3
- 2nd loop should print the numbers from 3 to 1 but doesn't proceed
- 3rd loop will print the numbers from 3 to 1 (because the range was inverted)
- 4th loop should print the numbers from 1 to 3 but doesn't proceed

b)
- Compilation Unit missing -> no compilation
- loop 2 and 4 will produce warnings and are not executed because they are executed on a null range
